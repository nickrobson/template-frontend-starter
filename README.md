## template-frontend-starter

### What is this?

This repository is intended as a template for quickly bootstrapping a webapp.

I made it because I'm getting tired of needing to sort out all the configuration
for every tool I want to use before I can get to writing the webapp I want to
make.

My main philosophy with this is that it should include everything you could
possibly need (within reason) to write a webapp, just leaving the implementation
of the webapp to be done.
